# Visual Correlation MT5

This code is for a MetaTrader 5 (MT5) indicator called Visual Correlation. This indicator calculates the correlation coefficient between different currency pairs and displays it as overlay bars on the chart. The correlation coefficient measures the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In the context of forex trading, it can help traders identify currency pairs that have a similar or opposite price movement.

## Input Parameters

- **period** (default: 20): The period for calculating the correlation coefficient.
- **overlayBars** (default: 20): The number of bars to overlay on the chart.
- **positiveColor** (default: Green): The color for positive correlation bars.
- **negativeColor** (default: Red): The color for negative correlation bars.
- **neutralColor** (default: Gray): The color for neutral correlation bars.

## Global Variables

- **correlation**: An array to store the correlation values between currency pairs.
- **barColors**: An array to store the color of each overlay bar.

## Initialization

The indicator initializes by setting the indicator buffers for the correlation values and bar colors. It also sets the indicator label as 'Visual Correlation MT5'.

## Calculate Correlation

The function **CalculateCorrelation()** calculates the correlation coefficient for each currency pair. It iterates through all the currency pairs and uses the **Corr()** function to calculate the correlation coefficient between the price series of each pair. The correlation coefficient is then stored in the **correlation** array, and the color of the overlay bar is determined based on the correlation value.

## Draw Overlay Bars

The function **DrawOverlayBars()** draws the overlay bars on the chart. It iterates through the overlay bars and currency pairs, retrieves the correlation value and bar color from the arrays, and then uses the **ChartScreenShot()** function to draw the overlay bar on the chart.

## Entry Point

The **OnStart()** function is the entry point of the program. It calls the **CalculateCorrelation()** function to calculate the correlation values and then calls the **DrawOverlayBars()** function to draw the overlay bars on the chart.
